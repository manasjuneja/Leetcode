# Complexity Analysis

## Solution 1

Time Complexity : O(n) : where n is the length of the given linked list
Space Complexity : O(n) : where n is the length of the given linked list


# Notes

## Solution 1

This program firstly reads the entire linked list into a list and then returns True or False based on the pallindrome condition.
