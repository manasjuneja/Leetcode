# Complexity Ananlysis

## Solution 1

Time Complexity: O(n) : where n is the total number of characters present in the string.
Space Complexity: O(n) : where n is the total number of characters present in the string.


# Notes

## Solution 1

This program considers a single character from the original string at a time. If that character is not a '.' then it just appends that character in a new string, but if it is '.', then it appends '[.]' in the new string. Finally that new string is returned.
