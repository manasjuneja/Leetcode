## Solution 1

In this program firstly the strings are converted into an array of characters so that each character can be compared indivisually. Each character from the RansomNote is considered and checked if it is there in the Magazine. If it is found that character is removed from the Magazine array. If all the characters are found then True is returned while if any of the character is not found then False is returned.
