Space Complexity : O(1)


# Note

## Solution 1 

This problem is solved by dynamic programming. The various steps of this program are: 1) firstly it figures out how big the array needs to be (i.e. n+1) 2) secondly it converts integers into binary 3) third it counts the number of 1's in the binary of that number 4) fourth it appends that number in the array 5) and finally the array is returned
