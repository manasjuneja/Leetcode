# Complexity Ananlysis

## Solution 1

O( n logn ) where n is the number of elements in the given array


## Solution 2

O( n^2 )  where n is the number of elements in the given array


# Notes 

## Solution 1 

Basically in this code firstly a list is created which stores the square values of each element in the initially given list. Then that list is sorted in an assending fashion.


## Solution 2

This solution is similar to the first solution but the only difference is that in this program bubble sort is used to sort the final array
