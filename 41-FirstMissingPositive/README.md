# Complexity Ananlysis

## Solution 1

Time Complexity : O( n ) : where n is the number of elements in the given array.
Space Complexity : O( 1)


# Note

## Solution 1

In this code firstly the array is sorted using the python built-in function, .sort(). Then the list is iterated to find the missing first positive integer.
