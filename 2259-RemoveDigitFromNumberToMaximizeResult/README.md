# Complexity Ananlysis

## Solution 1

O( n ) where n is the number of digits present in the given number

## Solution 2 

O( n ) where n is the total number of digits present in the given number


# Notes 

## Solution 1

Used brute-force method to solve this problem

## Solution 2

The logic behind this program is that the left-most occurrence is removed, if the following number is greater than it. If no such case is there then the last most occurrence is removed
