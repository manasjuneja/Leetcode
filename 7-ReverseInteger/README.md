Firstly it is checked if the given number is positive/negetive. Onece that is determined the number is converted into its absolute value (i.e. the negetive sign is removed if there is one ). The number is reversed by converting into string and reversing the string and converting it back to integer. After this the 32-bit condition is checked and according to that either 0 is returned or the number is returned. The number is also multiplied by -1 if the initially given integer was negetive.
