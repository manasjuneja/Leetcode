# Complexity Analysis

## solution 1
O( m*n ) where m is the the number of words given in the list and n is the number of alphabets of each word
= O( s ) where s is the number of characters in all the words in the list

## solution 2
O( m*n ) where m is the number of words given in the list and n is the number of alphabets in the shortest word of that list


# Notes
## solution 1
used horizontal search to compare alphabets of same index value
## solution 2 
finding common prefix and comparing it with each word one by one
