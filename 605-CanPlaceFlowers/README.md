# Complexity Analysis

## Solution 1

O( n ) where n is the number of elements in the array, which in this case is the number of plots where the flower can be planted.


# Note 

## Solution 1

In this program it first checks if the flowerbed has a single plot or not. If that is the case it returns true or false according to the number of new flowers that need to be planted. If that is not the case then the program continues to figure out what is the maximum number of new flowers that can be planted according to the given conditions. Then finally the program compares that maximum ammount to the required number of new flowers that are needed to be planted and returns true or false accordingly.
