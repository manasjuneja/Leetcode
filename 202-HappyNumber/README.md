# Complexity Ananlysis

## Solution 1

O( n log n ) where n is the number of elements in the given array

# Solution 2

O( n^2 ) where n is the number of elements in the given array

# Notes 

## Solution 1 

Basically in this code firstly a list is created which stores the square values of each element in the initially given list. Then that list is sorted in an assending fashion.

## Solution 2 

The program uses the same logic as the first one but this program also uses bubble sort to sort the final list.
