# Complexity Ananlysis

## Solution 1

Time Complexity : O(mn) where m and n is the number of elements in the list 1 and list 2 respectively.
Space Complexity : O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array 1


# Notes

## Solution 1

This program first checks if there is a common number between the two arrays, and if so then it returns the minimum of those number, If that is not the case then it finds the minimum number of the each array and converts it into a 2-digit number and then the least of those numbers is returned
